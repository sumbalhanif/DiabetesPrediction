# DiabetesPrediction
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes using health-related features.
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree Classifier is optimized using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
The final model achieved around 75% accuracy, with better performance on non-diabetic cases.
